			I have recently been introduced to the HAM Radio hobby and am thoroughly enjoying it. However due to my work and school careers both being away from home I am always looking for new local
			stations and repeaters wherever I move to. 
			<br>
			<br>
			There are other services out there which allow me to find stations around where I am at the time however they are fraught with inaccuracy and are hard to use. This project was started to
			develop a clean, easy to use, and good looking service. Additionally, I have aspirations to include tools such as declination and antenna angle calculators, to allow easy antenna positioning
			to target specific stations.
			<br>
			<br>
			The project is ambitious and will take my programming knowledge into knew territory, please be patient while I learn new techniques and methodologies.
			<br>
			<br>
			I hope you enjoy what the project can bring!
